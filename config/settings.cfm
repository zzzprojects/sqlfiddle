	If you leave this setting commented out, Wheels will try to determine the URL rewrite capabilities automatically.
	The URLRewriting setting can bet set to "On", "Partial" or "Off".
	To run with "Partial" rewriting, the "PATH_INFO" variable needs to be supported by the web server.
	To run with rewriting "On", you need to apply the necessary rewrite rules on the web server first.
	<cfset set(URLRewriting="Partial")>
